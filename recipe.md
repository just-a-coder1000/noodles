First rinse and shred or chop all the veggies, then set aside. You will need 1 cup shredded cabbage, ½ shredded carrots, 8 to 10 french beans (thinly sliced or finely chopped), ⅓ sliced capsicum and ⅓ cup chopped spring onion whites.
Increase the quantity of veggies according to your preferences. Add some cremini or button mushrooms if you like.
Next heat 5 to 6 cups of water in a pan.
Then when the water comes to a boil, add ½ teaspoon salt.
Next add ½ teaspoon oil and mix well. Add any neutral oil
Then add the noodles (about 200 grams). I have used whole wheat noodles. The recipe is customizable with any noodles – instant, ramen, soba, chow mein, udon, rice.
Cook the noodles you will be using according to the package instructions as every variety of noodle will have a different cooking time.For any variety of noodle, you need to cook them until al dente.
Now boil until the noodles are cooked al dente.
Be sure to check the doneness throughout the noodles recipe by pressing a few noodles or tasting them. They should be softened, but still have a slight bite to them.
Then drain the cooked noodles in a colander or sieve.
Next rinse the noodles with fresh water.
After that, set aside. You can even toss the noodles recipe with 2 to 3 teaspoons oil if desired.
Now heat 2 to 3 tablespoons of toasted sesame oil in a wok or pan. Keep the heat to low or medium-low. Add 1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic and 1 teaspoon finely chopped ginger.Swap toasted sesame oil with any neutral oil or olive oil.
Next stir-fry or sauté for some seconds.
Then increase the flame to high and add ⅓ cup chopped spring onions (scallions).
After that, keep on stirring continuously and stir fry the onions until they become translucent.
Then add thinly sliced french beans (about 8 to 10 beans which have been thinly sliced).
Next continue to stir fry for 2 to 3 minutes on a medium to high heat.
Then add the veggies: ½ cup shredded carrots, ⅓ cup thinly sliced capsicum and 1 cup shredded cabbage.
Now continue to toss and stir fry on a medium to high heat until the veggies are almost cooked. If possible it is best to use a pan with handles as it is better to lift it while tossing.You can also decrease the flame if the heat becomes too much to handle and then stir fry the veggies on a medium heat.
Some crunch should be there in the vegetables, so don’t cook the vegetables until they become completely soft.
Then add 1 to 2 teaspoons of finely chopped celery. You can skip celery if you do not have it.
Next add 1 to 2 tablespoons of soy sauce. Mix well.  (NOTE: Try to use naturally brewed soy sauce.)
Then add salt and crushed pepper as required.
Stir and mix very well.
Now add the cooked noodles.
Keep on tossing and stirring till the veggies are mixed well for minute or two. Switch off the heat. Check the taste and add more salt, black pepper or soy sauce if required to the veggie noodles.
Then add 1 teaspoon rice vinegar or regular white vinegar. You can even skip vinegar or add mirin or rice wine.
Lastly add 1 to 2 tablespoons chopped spring onion greens. Mix well.
Finally, serve this veg noodles recipe steaming hot as it is or with some black bean sauce or tomato sauce.
